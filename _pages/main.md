[The Impact of Unconditional Cash Transfers on Parenting and Children](/assets/ORUS_Children.pdf)
: *with Elizabeth Rhodes, Alex Bartik, David Broockman, Patrick Krause and Eva Vivalt,* NBER Working Paper
: <details><summary><ins>Abstract</ins></summary> This paper examines the impact of a large, randomized cash transfer on parental behaviors, investment in children, children's social, behavioral, and educational outcomes, and pregnancy and childbearing. We find that parents who were randomly selected to receive a $1,000 per month unconditional cash transfer for three years spent more on their children each month and reported better parenting behaviors (such as supervising their children more closely) compared to those randomized to receive $50 per month over the same period. However, possibly due to this closer monitoring, parents in the treatment group also reported that their child was experiencing more developmental difficulties and stress. Parents with the lowest incomes at baseline experienced the largest improvements in parenting; among these parents, the transfer also increased the use and quality of non-parental child care. The transfer did not have a meaningful effect on most educational outcomes measured in school administrative records, nor did it affect characteristics of the home environment, child food security, exposure to homelessness, or parental satisfaction. Although treated families were more likely to move, we did not detect changes in most measures of neighborhood quality, though proximity to child-focused amenities such as daycares appeared to increase in the treatment group relative to the control group. The transfer did not affect childbearing, pregnancy, or outcomes related to contraception. While the transfer reduced parents' stress and mental distress in the first year of the program, these effects were short-lived and dissipated by the second year of the transfer, analogous to what was documented previously in the full population of participants.  </details>

[The Labor Market and Health Impacts of Reducing Cesarean Section Deliveries](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34556)
: *with Petra Persson, Maya Rossin-Slater, and Laura R. Wherry,*  revise and resubmit, *Journal of Human Resources* 
: <details><summary><ins>Abstract</ins></summary> One in three births in the United States is delivered by cesarean section (c-section). This paper studies the labor market and health effects of c-sections, using newly linked administrative data that combines the universe of California birth records with mothers' quarterly earnings. We analyze the impact of an intervention that reduced c-section rates among low-risk first-time births, and show that mothers exposed to the intervention are more likely to be employed in the quarter following birth, and more likely to return to their pre-birth employer. These impacts attenuate over time---suggesting that a c-section primarily delays return to the labor market following childbirth---but attachment to the pre-birth employer remains higher five quarters post-birth. Further, among mothers who have another child, we find that exposure to the intervention at the first birth leads to a lower likelihood of c-section and preterm delivery at the second one, implying that both the economic and health benefits of reduced c-sections may compound with birth order. </details>

[The Causal Effects of Income on Political Attitudes and Behavior: A Randomized Field Experiment](https://www.nber.org/papers/w32784)
: *with Elizabeth Rhodes, Alex Bartik, David Broockman, Karina Dotson, Patrick Krause and Eva Vivalt,* NBER Working Paper
: <details><summary><ins>Abstract</ins></summary> We study the causal effects of income on political attitudes and behavior with a field experiment. In the experiment, a non-profit gifted 1,000 low-income Americans $1,000 per month for three years tax-free, and 2,000 control participants $50 monthly. Contrary to resource models of participation, we find no effects on political participation or engagement, and rule out effects equivalent to the observational association between turnout and income. Political preferences largely do not change, with the estimates again distinguishable from the observational relationship that economic conservatism increases with income. Dispositions such as trust in government, polarization, and support for democracy also do not change. We do find effects consistent with mood misattribution: affect towards one's own racial group, other racial groups, and some politicians slightly improves. There is also some evidence that treated participants saw work as more important for individuals, society, or even as a requirement for accessing government programs; qualitative evidence illuminates potential mechanisms. Our findings contrast with findings from other economic shocks such as government-sponsored or taxable transfers—thereby helping clarify the mechanisms likely responsible for their effects—and underscore the durability of political predispositions.  </details>

[The Impact of Unconditional Cash Transfers on Consumption and Household Balance Sheets: Experimental Evidence from Two US States](https://www.nber.org/papers/w32784)
: *with Elizabeth Rhodes, Alex Bartik, David Broockman, Patrick Krause and Eva Vivalt,* NBER Working Paper
: <details><summary><ins>Abstract</ins></summary> We provide new evidence on the causal effect of unearned income on consumption, balance sheets, and financial outcomes by exploiting an experiment that randomly assigned 1000 individuals to receive $1000 per month and 2000 individuals to receive $50 per month for three years. The transfer increased measured household expenditures by at least $300 per month. The spending impact is positive in most categories, and is largest for housing, food, and car expenses. The treatment increases housing unit and neighborhood mobility. We find noisily estimated modest positive effects on asset values, driven by financial assets, but these gains are offset by higher debt, resulting in a near-zero effect on net worth. The transfer increased self-reported financial health and credit scores but did not affect credit limits, delinquencies, utilization, bankruptcies, or foreclosures. Adjusting for underreporting, we estimate marginal propensities to consume non-durables between 0.44 and 0.55, durables and semi-durables between 0.21 and 0.26, and marginal propensities to de-lever of near zero. These results suggest that large temporary transfers increase short-term consumption and improve financial health but may not cause persistent improvements in the financial position of young, low-income households.  </details>

[Does Income Affect Health? Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial of a Guaranteed Income](/assets/ORUS_Health.pdf)
: *with Elizabeth Rhodes, Alex Bartik, David Broockman, Patrick Krause and Eva Vivalt,* revise and resubmit, *American Economic Review* 
: <details><summary><ins>Abstract</ins></summary> This paper provides new evidence on the causal relationship between income and health by studying a randomized experiment in which 1,000 low-income adults in the United States received $1,000 per month for three years, with 2,000 control participants receiving $50 over that same period. The cash transfer resulted in large but short-lived improvements in stress and food security, greater use of hospital and emergency department care, and increased medical spending of about $20 per month in the treatment relative to the control group. Our results also suggest that the use of other office-based care---particularly dental care---may have increased as a result of the transfer. However, we find no effect of the transfer across several measures of physical health as captured by multiple well-validated survey measures and biomarkers derived from blood draws. We can rule out even very small improvements in physical health and the effect that would be implied by the cross-sectional correlation between income and health lies well outside our confidence intervals. We also find that the transfer did not improve mental health after the first year and by year 2 we can again reject very small improvements. We also find precise null effects on self-reported access to health care, physical activity, sleep, and several other measures related to preventive care and health behaviors. Our results imply that more targeted interventions may be more effective at reducing health inequality between high- and low-income individuals, at least for the population and time frame that we study. </details>

[Covering Undocumented Immigrants: The Effects of A Large-Scale Prenatal Care Intervention](/assets/MillerWherryUndocumented.pdf)
: *with Laura R. Wherry,* revise and resubmit, *AEJ: Economic Policy*
: <details><summary><ins>Abstract</ins></summary> Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for public insurance coverage for prenatal care in most states, despite their children representing a large fraction of births and having U.S. citizenship. In this paper, we examine a policy that expanded Medicaid pregnancy coverage to undocumented immigrants. Using a novel dataset that links California birth records to Census surveys, we identify siblings born to immigrant mothers before and after the policy. Implementing a mothers' fixed effects design, we find that the policy increased coverage for and use of prenatal care among pregnant immigrant women, and increased average gestation length and birth weight among their children.</details>
